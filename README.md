# NideeshGPT - My AI Agent Portfolio 💪 – [nideesh.ai](https://nideesh.ai)

## Overview  

Welcome to my personal website, NideeshGPT! You can ask the AI Agent anything about me and it will try its best to answer. It can answer queries about my resume, my interests, and anything in between. I told it to not lie, but sometimes it may make mistakes, so don't trust anything it says 100%. Trust it as much as you would trust ChatGPT (which for me is a lot ig).
